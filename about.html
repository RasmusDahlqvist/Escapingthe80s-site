<p>You are probably wondering what kind of team is behind this divine masterpiece and how we ended up doing this project. It’s quite ordinary story; three freshman students studying Information Technology in Metropolia University of Applied Sciences.</p>



<p>I’m Julia Virtanen, 24 years old IT-student from Helsinki. I have graduated from Helsinki School of Natural Sciences in 2012. After that I have worked as practical nurse for 5 years in different hospitals. First time I thought changing field of work was couple of years ago. I have never thought I’d be a boffin, but constantly developing industry and limitless options cut the dash in me. And the more I study and learn, the more convinced I am that this is the biz for me! </p>
