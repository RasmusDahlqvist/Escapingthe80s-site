				<p>You wake up in a room. You can’t remember how you ended up there, but the hangover you are having is about to kill you. The Journey’s “Don’t stop believin’ is stuck in your head and it only makes your hangover worst. You start to look around you. You see these hideous furniture and other stuff. A huge poster of a nearly naked David Hasselhoff is on the wall. And then it hits you… You’re stuck in the 80’s! You need to get away from here and back to the civilisation. But obviously, the door is locked. <br>And  the journey begins… <br>

<p>Escape the 80’s is text adventure game, based on room escape. The game is placed in the 80’s Miami and it takes the player back to the era of fanny packs and lava lamps. 

You want to re-live the 80’s? Take a sneak peek how it was back then? You like to solve puzzles and challenge yourself? And the most important question… Do you love David Hasselhoff? If you said yes, this is the game for you! Accept the challenge and jump back in time, just so you can escape the 80’s!</p></p>
